# Time-Series Projects

This repository contains a collection of time series forecasting projects. These projects demonstrate the application of various time series models such as ARIMA, Autoregression (AR), and FB-Prophet for forecasting and analysis.

## Projects:

### 1. Time-Series Analysis using FB-Prophet
- **Goal**: Predict time series data for April, May, June, July, August, and September of 2021.
- **Model Used**: Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting.

### 2. Time Series Forecasting - Autoregression (AR)
- **Goal**: Forecast time series data using the Autoregression approach. 
- **Datasets**: 
  - JetRail Commuter Traffic
  - Air Passengers
  - Function Autoregression with Air Passengers
  - Function Autoregression with Wine Sales

### 3. Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA Models
- **Goal**: Forecast time series data using the ARIMA model.
- **Dataset**: COVID-19 infections in Saudi Arabia.

### 4. ARIMA with Fourier Terms
- **Goal**: Tune the ARIMA model using Fourier terms to capture multiple seasonalities.
- **Dataset**: Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting from Kaggle.

### 5. Finding the Best Distribution That Fits Data using Fitter
- **Goal**: Use the Fitter library to find the best statistical distribution for time series data and compute Z-scores for a log-normal distribution.
